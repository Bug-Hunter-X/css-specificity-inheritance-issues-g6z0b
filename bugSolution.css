The following CSS code demonstrates the solution:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container span {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: blue;
}

.container span.highlight {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.container p span {
  color: red !important; /* Solution 1: Use !important */
}
/* OR */
.container p span {
  color: red; 
}
```

This addresses the issue by either using `!important` (Solution 1) to force the application of the `color: red` declaration or simply making the style more specific by removing inheritance (Solution 2). Both effectively solves the issue, though the `!important` approach should be used sparingly.  Solution 2, removing inheritance, is the preferable approach in most cases.
